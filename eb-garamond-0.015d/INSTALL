=Installation notes=

==Linux==
Copy the folder inside $HOME/.fonts/ directory and then run 'fc-cache' program.
You can check if the fonts are included into the Fontconfig database by running 'fc-list |grep EB Garamond'.
You can also use your desktop environment (e.g., KDE) to install fonts.
This is per-user install. For system-wide installation refer to the Fontconfig manual.

==Windows==
Select all OTF files. Right click, then select "Install".
To check results navigate to C:\Windows\Fonts folder and look for "EB Garamond" family.
