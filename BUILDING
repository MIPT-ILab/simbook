== Build requirements ==

1) TeXLive 2013 installed with support of Russian language, XeLaTeX, Tikz, biblatex, biber.
2) Both Windows and Linux hosts should be able to build

==Build variants==
Several variants of builds for the book are avaialble:
* web - a PDF formatted for reading from screen, currently developed kind.
* print - a PDF prepared for print, with publisher output data. This is actual only during preparation for a physical paper edition.
* html - a HTML for online viewing. Note that this version is experimental and most likely broken.

==Memory consumption note==
The build of web version takes a lot of memory. To increase TeX internal limits:
* Find a texmf.cnf configuration file with 'kpsewhich texmf.cnf' command
* Edit texmf.cnf file to include the line:
    main_memory = 9000000 
* Generate configuration by running 'fmtutil-sys --all' (may be as root) and 'fmtutil --all' as regular user.

== Build sequence ==
Choose a <version> to build. The top file for it is main-<version>.tex.

1) cd metoda
2) xelatex main-<version>.tex
3) biber main-<version>
4) xelatex main-<version>.tex
5) xelatex main-<version>.tex

The result is in main-<version>.pdf.
